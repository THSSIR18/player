this program is a mini game where you get to choose from the players (a mage, archer, juggernaut, or warrior) based on that you will have a certain number of hit points (health) and dodge percentage which is how well you dodged attacks of shots, arrows, fireballs, ice storms, meteors, etc. that can ultimately damage you.
